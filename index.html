    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a sixty year old woman who worked in too many jobs and studied at 
        too many places to list them all here.  I'll select the ones I enjoyed 
        the most and some that were quite interesting.  I loved being an air 
        hostess when it was still glamorous to be one.  I worked in the family 
        business doing the accounts with my mum while my dad was The Boss.  
        I also worked in a pub in Maidenhead, Berkshire in England, which was
        a great chance to observe and learn more about the locals.
